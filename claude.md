# X - High-Performance Cryptocurrency Miner

X is a high-performance, cross-platform cryptocurrency miner forked from XMRIG, designed to support multiple proof-of-work algorithms with optimized performance across CPU, NVIDIA GPU, and AMD GPU hardware.

## About X

X is an open-source mining software that has been rebranded and enhanced to provide:
- Multi-algorithm support (RandomX, CryptoNight, KawPow, GhostRider, Argon2, and more)
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD)
- Hardware acceleration for CPUs and GPUs
- Advanced features for professional miners and enthusiasts

## Key Features

- **Multi-Algorithm Support**: Mine various cryptocurrencies using different proof-of-work algorithms
- **Hardware Optimization**: Optimized backends for CPU, CUDA (NVIDIA), and OpenCL (AMD)
- **Professional Grade**: Built-in API, multiple pool support, failover capabilities
- **Open Source**: Transparent, auditable code with active development

## Default Mining Configuration

By default, X supports the TARI (XTM) cryptocurrency using the RandomX algorithm. The default donation level is set to 1% to support continued development.

### Default Pool Configuration
- **Pool**: pool-global.tari.snipanet.com:3333
- **Algorithm**: RandomX (for TARI/XTM)
- **Donation Level**: 1% (1 minute per 100 minutes)
- **Worker Name**: Automatically generated 8-character random identifier

## Development Support

X includes a 1% developer donation that helps support ongoing development, optimization, and maintenance of the project. This ensures:
- Continuous performance improvements
- New algorithm implementations
- Bug fixes and security updates
- Cross-platform compatibility maintenance
- New feature development

## Building X

X uses CMake as its build system:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

For platform-specific build instructions, refer to the documentation in the `/doc` directory.

## Usage

Basic usage:
```bash
./x -o pool_address:port -u wallet_address -p password
```

For TARI/XTM mining (default):
```bash
./x -o pool-global.tari.snipanet.com:3333 -u YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS -a rx/0
```

## Configuration

X can be configured via:
- Command-line arguments
- JSON configuration file (`config.json`)
- HTTP API (for runtime control)

See the example configuration files in the project root for detailed setup options.
